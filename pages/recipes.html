        <a><img src="../images/grilled_cheese.webp"></a>
        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h3>
                A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food made by placing cheese between two slices of bread and then grilling or toasting it until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted. It’s typically made with buttered bread and can be as simple or as fancy as you like. Some people add extras like tomatoes, bacon, or various types of cheese to enhance the flavor. It’s beloved for its crispy exterior and gooey, melty interior!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread: Usually sliced white or whole wheat bread, but you can use any type you like.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Cheddar is a popular choice, but you can use other types like American, Swiss, or mozzarella, depending on your taste.</li>
            <li>Butter: Used to spread on the outside of the bread to achieve a crispy, golden-brown texture when grilled.</li>
            <li>Optional: Seasonings, such as garlic powder or a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add-ins: Like tomatoes, bacon, or herbs for extra flavor.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>How do you make it?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the Bread:

                        Take the two slices of bread and set them aside.</li>
                        <li>Butter the Bread:

                            Spread a thin, even layer of softened butter on one side of each slice of bread. Make sure the entire surface is covered to achieve an even golden-brown crust.</li>
                        <li>Assemble the Sandwich:

                                Place the cheese slices on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread. You can layer the cheese or mix types if you like. Place the second slice of bread on top, buttered side up.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the Pan:

                            Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Grill the Sandwich:

                            Carefully place the sandwich in the skillet. Cook for 2-4 minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted. Press down slightly with a spatula to ensure even grilling and good cheese melting.</li>
                        <li>Check for Doneness:

                            Flip the sandwich carefully with a spatula to avoid spilling the cheese. Adjust the heat if the bread is browning too quickly.</li>
                        <li>Serve:

                            Once both sides are golden brown and the cheese is melted, remove the sandwich from the pan. Let it cool for a minute before cutting in half, if desired.</li>
                </ol>
